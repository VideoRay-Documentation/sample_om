<h1>Software Guide</h1>

<div class="internal">

<p>The Software Guide should fully describe all of the software items for the system.  This includes software administration including installation and updates.  Operational aspects of the software, other than how to start it, should be addressed in the Operations Guide.  Additional sections and pages may need to be added to this section as necessary.</p>
