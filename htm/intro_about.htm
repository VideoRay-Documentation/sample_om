<p>This document provides an example of an Operator's Manual.  When creating a new Operator's Manual, the structure of the document and most of the content for administrative pages are defined by template files and boilerplate text.  Some of the template files, such as the one for this page (required/htm/intro_about.htm), contain an include directive &lt;!--i--&gt;&lt;!--/i--&gt; that allows you to supplement the boilerplate with project specific text from a local file (intro_about.htm) in the project folder.  "Normal" style text on this page is from the boilerplate file.  Text in red, like this text, is from the local included file.  Using a local file is optional.  In this remainder of this manual, red text is used to describe the purpose and suggested content for each page.  In subsequent pages, the local file name for the page will be listed first, followed by the notes, as shown next for this page.</p>

<p>Local file: intro_about.htm</p>

<p>This page should provide the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify the product</li>
  <li>Explain the purpose of the document</li>
  <li>Identify the target audience for the document</li>
  </ul>
